# CLRT19's Machine Learning Study Journey

## Introduction

This is a repository for CLRT19's machine learning study journey. The purpose of this repository is to record the process of learning ML and to share the knowledge with others. When I was organizing my Probability notes, I found it help me remember the knowledge better by writing it down. So I decided to write down the knowledge I learned in the process of learning ML. I hope this repository can help you learn ML better.
